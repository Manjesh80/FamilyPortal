## Code Example


## Motivation

I'm using this project to learn how to create a web application using Node.js. Another ulterior motive is to try out the different Node.js frameworks out there (No Framework, Express, Sails, Hapi, Kraken, etc.) and also front end frameworks (angular.js, ember.js, react / flux, backbone)

## Installation

Clone the project 

``` git clone https://github.com/prabinv/FamilyPortal/ FamilyPortal```

or fork the project

Run ```npm install```

Run ```node server.js```

and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. 

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
